    <p>[The same room. The mist still lies heavy over the landscape.]
        <br>

        [MANDERS and MRS. ALVING enter from the dining-room.]
        <br>
        
        MRS. ALVING. [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ [Note: A phrase
        equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
        on appetite.], Mr. Manders. [Turns back towards the dining-room.] Aren't
        you coming too, Oswald?
        <br>
        
        OSWALD. [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.
        <br>
        
        MRS. ALVING. Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now. [She
        shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] Regina!
        <br>
        
        REGINA. [Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?
        <br>
        
        MRS. ALVING. Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.
        <br>
        
        REGINA. Yes, Mrs. Alving.
        <br>
        
        [MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]
        <br>
        
        MANDERS. I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?
        <br>
        
        MRS. ALVING. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.
        <br>
        
        MANDERS. I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
        morsel of dinner.
        <br>
        
        MRS. ALVING. [Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.] Nor I.
        But what is to be done now?
