    <p>[The same room. The mist still lies heavy over the landscape.]</p>

    <p>[MANDERS and MRS. ALVING enter from the dining-room.]</p>

    <h4>MRS. ALVING.</h4>
    <p>
    <p>[Still in the doorway.]</p>
    <p class="speech"> Mr. Manders.</p>
    <p> [Turns back towards the dining-room.]</p>
    <p>Aren't
        you coming too, Oswald?</p>
    </p>

    <h4>OSWALD.</h4>
    <p>
    <p>[From within.]</p>
    <p>No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.</p>
    </p>


    <h4>MRS. ALVING.</h4>
    <p>
    <p>Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now.</p>
    <p>[She shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] </p>
    <p>Regina!</p>
    </p>


    <h4>REGINA.</h4>
    <p>
    <p>[Outside.]</p>
    <p> Yes, Mrs. Alving? </p>
    </p>


    <h4>MRS. ALVING.</h4>
    <p> Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.</p>


    <h4>REGINA.</h4>
    <p> Yes, Mrs. Alving.</p>


    <p>[MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]</p>


    <h4>MANDERS.</h4>
    <p>I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?</p>


    <h4>MRS. ALVING.</h4>
    <p> Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.</p>


    <h4>MANDERS.</h4>
    <p>I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
        morsel of dinner.</p>


    <h4>MRS. ALVING.</h4>
    <p>
    <p>[Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.]</p>
    <p> Nor I.
        But what is to be done now? </p>
    </p>
