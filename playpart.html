    <p>MRS. ALVING. Unfortunately there is no possibility of mistake. Johanna
        confessed everything to me; and Alving could not deny it. So there was
        nothing to be done but to get the matter hushed up.

        <br>

        MANDERS. No, you could do nothing else.

        <br>

        MRS. ALVING. The girl left our service at once, and got a good sum of
        money to hold her tongue for the time. The rest she managed for herself
        when she got to town. She renewed her old acquaintance with Engstrand,
        no doubt let him see that she had money in her purse, and told him some
        tale about a foreigner who put in here with a yacht that summer. So she
        and Engstrand got married in hot haste. Why, you married them yourself.

        <br>

        MANDERS. But then how to account for--? I recollect distinctly Engstrand
        coming to give notice of the marriage. He was quite overwhelmed with
        contrition, and bitterly reproached himself for the misbehaviour he and
        his sweetheart had been guilty of.

        <br>

        MRS. ALVING. Yes; of course he had to take the blame upon himself.

        <br>

        MANDERS. But such a piece of duplicity on his part! And towards me too!
        I never could have believed it of Jacob Engstrand. I shall not fail
        to take him seriously to task; he may be sure of that.--And then the
        immorality of such a connection! For money--! How much did the girl
        receive?

        <br>

        MRS. ALVING. Three hundred dollars.
